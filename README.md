# userStoryC
## Small project where Stripe was integrated with React with a Node backend.
## Response is sent to stripe api whenever the user makes a payment request but unfortunately STRIPE does not accept request from http. It always gives you an error, but in the developer console of the stripe account, the request can be seen and recognized.
